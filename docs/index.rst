AMD Simulation documentation
********************************************************************

AMD Simulation is an open-source software toolkit built on the ROCm™ platform,
enabling high-performance physical simulations and advanced computational graphics
on AMD GPUs. This toolkit enables workloads such as scientific computing, computer
graphics, robotics, and AI-driven simulation to run on AMD Instinct™ GPUs and benefit
from the optimizations available on those GPUs. AMD Simulation builds on the core
ROCm libraries to combine frameworks and specialized libraries that accelerate
physics-based and numerical simulations.

These tools use ROCm's HIP runtime, optimized math libraries, and PyTorch
integration to deliver high throughput for compute-intensive tasks. This provides
you with efficient, scalable solutions for real-time and offline simulation workloads.
Physical simulation workloads, such as fluid mechanics, rigid-body dynamics, and
volumetric rendering, require significant computational resources. By leveraging
ROCm's open-source GPU stack together with the AMD Instinct product line, you gain
performance from optimized kernels, flexibility from integration with Python and
machine learning frameworks, and scalability with multi-GPU clusters and high-
performance computing (HPC) support.

AMD Simulation provides a cohesive set of libraries and frameworks that support
the simulation workflow, from physics kernels and numerical solvers to
rendering and multi-GPU scaling. Each component is optimized for GPU performance 
on AMD Instinct GPUs while offering Python-friendly APIs and integrations with
popular tools such as PyTorch, so that you can plug simulation workloads into existing 
research and production pipelines with minimal friction.
